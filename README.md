Basic Syntactical Analyzer

Project Overview:

Utilizing the lexical analyzer from Assignment 1, the team was tasked with constructing a basic
syntactical analyzer, the next and second step in the compilation process. We were allowed to use
any top-down parser which included a RDP, predictive recursive descent parser, or a table driven
predictive parser. Whichever approach was chosen had to remove left recursion and, if necessary,
use left factorization. At the end, the analyzer should print a file of tokens, lexemes, the
production rules used, and the assembly code instructions. To get more points, the team had to
implement Scope Checking, Type Checking, Testing, or Error Handling.
